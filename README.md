# Extracellular Recording Site Simulator

The Extracellular Recording Site Simulator (ERSS) is a tool for creating biophysically realistic recording sites given a probe geometry and brain region. ERSS currently supports the Neuropixels probe geometry and a detailed Somatosensory cortex column brain region of a rat.
 

## Getting Started

```python
git clone 
print s
```

### Uses

This software was designed as an intial step in creating brain/probe specific evaluation datasets for
spike sorting. It allows for realistic generation of extracellular recording sites for different probe geometries within different brain regions.

### Future Work

More probes will be implemented (Neuroseeker, H-Series, tetrodes,  etc.) along with more brain regions (BlueBrain neocortical volume, hippocampus, thalamus, etc.) and more animals (mouse).
